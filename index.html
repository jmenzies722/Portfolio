            <h3>Predicting AirBnB Prices in NYC</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the prices of AirBnB listings in New York City (NYC). By employing Python, TensorFlow, and a 5-layer MLP neural network, we analyze a historical dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to accurately forecast AirBnB prices and compare the performance of our MLP neural network with a linear regression model using scikit-learn. The project provides valuable insights for individuals interested in renting or investing in AirBnB properties in NYC.</p>

            <h3>Best Places to Invest in CT</h3>
            <p>In this project, our team aimed to identify the best places to live in Connecticut (CT). We utilized the CART algorithm and an MLP neural network to evaluate town data, including demographic information, economic indicators, and quality-of-life metrics. The CART algorithm achieved a 97% performance score, outperforming the MLP neural network, which scored 91%. Based on our analysis, we identified four top-ranking towns in CT that offer attractive investment opportunities. This project provides valuable insights for individuals seeking the best places to live and invest in Connecticut.</p>
